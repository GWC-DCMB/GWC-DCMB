# Anti-Racism Statement

The Executive Committee of Girls Who Code at UM DCMB condemns the wrongful and tragic deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and so many others who have suffered and died at the hands of police brutality and structural racism. We echo statements from GWC national leadership, and promise to use our organization to protect and empower members of the Black community and those who, in addition to facing systemic racism daily, are underrepresented in computer science and STEM fields. We are working to improve our facilitator training to explicitly include anti-racism education and ensure we reflect these values in our weekly club meetings and other operations. We invite you to hold us accountable to this commitment by emailing thoughts, questions, or concerns to gwc.bioinfo-requests@umich.edu.

We want to share some anti-racism resources, and we encourage those not directly burdened by structural racism to become more informed and active allies. We know there are many resources being circulated through social media on anti-racism/allyship as well as self- and community-care; please email us at gwc.bioinfo-requests@umich.edu to share anything you think this group could benefit from reading. If you have an idea for how our organization can do a better job of responding to racism, please reach out and let us know.
