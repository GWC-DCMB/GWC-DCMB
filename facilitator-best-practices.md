## How can I be the best facilitator I can be? 

During the starter activity:
- Touch base with the Lead Facilitator to see if there is anything specific that needs to be done or any special activities occurring that day.
- Answer any questions the students may have and help them work through the starter questions as described below in “For Practice Problems & Challenge Questions.”
- If you want to be the one to go over the starter questions, talk with the Lead Facilitator.

During the guest speaker presentation:
- Ideally, listen to the speaker. 
- If you want to be on your laptop, make sure you’re in the back so you’re not distracting the students.

During the live coding lessons:
- Help learners who put up red stickies
- Look for learners who are falling behind and see if you can assist them

For Practice Problems & Challenge Questions:
- Ideally, don’t be on your laptop - be wandering around looking for students who put up a red sticky, raise their hand, or seem to have been stuck on a particular question for a while.
- Feel free to stick with one student for a while and help them through the questions if they seem very lost and/or behind. 

During the activity break:
- Participate along with the students. Be enthusiastic!

How to help a student who is stuck:
- DO:
  - Check that the student has gone through the troubleshooting checklist. 
  - Read the question and see if the student understands what it means. If they don’t, have them figure it out by asking them pointed questions. Once they seem to understand, have them try to answer the questions on their own.
  - Continue giving them guided feedback by asking them questions about what step they should do next.
  - If they don’t seem to understand a general concept, take the time to explain it to them before having them try to answer the question itself.
- DO NOT:
  - Give the student the answer to the question.
  - Touch the computer. You should not be typing anything into the computer for the student. They won't learn that way.
