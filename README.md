A meta-repository to help navigate the repos and resources of 
[Girls Who Code at UM-DCMB](http://umich.edu/~girlswc/).

## About Us

Founded by current doctoral students in the 
[Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics (DCMB)](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/computational-medicine-bioinformatics) 
at the University of Michigan, our Girls Who Code club seeks to provide a 
collaborative and supportive environment for high school women of all skill levels 
and backgrounds interested in learning how to code.

Due to the research expertise of our graduate student Facilitators, our club 
curriculum is focused on computational data analysis and the Python programming 
language. Participants learn core coding concepts and implement their new skills 
in a data science capstone project of their choosing.
