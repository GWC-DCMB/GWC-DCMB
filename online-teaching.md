# Resources for online teaching

*Thanks to [Preparing Future Faculty](http://crlt.umich.edu/programs/pff) 2020 for suggesting many of these resources!*

## Planning online courses

When teaching online, what you want your students to learn (i.e. your learning objectives) should be the same. What might be different is the activities and assessments you design to facilitate learning. You shouldn't just convert your course directly into an online format - [this article](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Why-You-Shouldn-t-Try-to/248664?cid=wcontentlist_hp_latest) from the Chronicle of Higher Education explains why.
