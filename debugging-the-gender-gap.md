## Call to Action

1. Parents/guardians, remind your children or colleagues that the feelings from imposter syndrome affect almost everyone, and it doesn’t mean you don’t belong.
2. Parents/guardians, particularly men who are role models and father figures, encourage girls to do absolutely anything they want in their careers.
3. Everyone, advocate for earlier and better computer science education in schools, particularly computational thinking classes!
4. Everyone, find a community where you can network, mentor or receive mentorship, learn from others, and feel less isolated.
5. Educators, focus on early computer science educational opportunities that produce ‘easy wins’ and build confidence.
6. An adult interested in coding, it’s not too late! Identify the ways computer science is embedded in your field of interest and pursue them.
