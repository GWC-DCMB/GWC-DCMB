# Welcome learner!

### What you need
- A computer with an internet browser (we know Chrome works well)  
- Internet access  
-  Each learner will need a [Google Account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en) to save edited notebooks into their own Google Drive.  

### Accessing the curriculum
Our Python for Data Science [curriculum](https://github.com/GWC-DCMB/ClubCurriculum) has 29 topics. Every topic has a [lesson](https://github.com/GWC-DCMB/ClubCurriculum/tree/master/Lessons) and a [practice](https://github.com/GWC-DCMB/ClubCurriculum/tree/master/Practices). Both lessons and practices are designed to take 15-30 minutes each. The content is written for learners ages 14-18, but could be useful for younger or older learners as well.

**Start** with the [first lesson](https://github.com/GWC-DCMB/ClubCurriculum/blob/master/Lessons/Lesson01_Jupyter-Setup.md) which explains how to use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) to load the [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org) which contain the lessons and practices.

 The **answer keys** are in the lesson and practice directories so you can find the answer if you get stuck, but here are direct links to the PDFs: 
- [Lesson keys](https://github.com/GWC-DCMB/ClubCurriculum/tree/master/Lessons/_Keys/pdf)
- [Practice keys](https://github.com/GWC-DCMB/ClubCurriculum/tree/master/Practices/_Keys/pdf)

We also have [challenge questions](https://github.com/GWC-DCMB/challengeQuestions/tree/master/questions) for extensions of certain topics. You can navigate to these via Google Colab by following the instructions in the [first lesson](https://github.com/GWC-DCMB/ClubCurriculum/blob/master/Lessons/Lesson01_Jupyter-Setup.md). You can navgiate  to all of our organization's resources from [here](https://github.com/GWC-DCMB/GWC-DCMB). 

### Tips for self-instruction
1. We encourage lots of googlingâ€”-resources like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) are particularly useful.  
2. Here is a [guide](https://github.com/GWC-DCMB/GWC-DCMB/blob/master/troubleshooting-checklist.md) for what to do when stuck.  
3. If you're a high school student, join our [Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/dcmbgirlswhocode/shared_invite/zt-cl70c3pu-l61UdX4p~NwFtu0fMRim2g) and ask questions in the `#officehours` channel. Our volunteers will answer as they are able. 
4. You may want to start with something like Code Academy to learn some programming basics. [Python 2](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) content is free, but [Python 3](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3) is not. Then jump into our curriculum which teaches Python 3 and data science specific skills. Python 3 is an updated version of Python 2.

### Extensions
We have compiled many [learning resources](https://github.com/GWC-DCMB/GWC-DCMB/blob/master/learning-resources.md), but we would like to highlight a few of our favorites
- [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com) 
- [Teach yourself R](https://github.com/zenalapp/teach-yourself-r/wiki) by Maya and Zena Lapp
