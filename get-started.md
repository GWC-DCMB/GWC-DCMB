You can access all our resources [here](https://github.com/GWC-DCMB/GWC-DCMB). 
The [first lesson](https://github.com/GWC-DCMB/ClubCurriculum/blob/master/Lessons/Lesson01_Jupyter-Setup.md) of our [club curriculum](https://github.com/GWC-DCMB/ClubCurriculum) explains how to use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) to load the [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org) which contain the lessons and practices. Each learner will need a [Google Account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en) to save edited notebooks into their own Google Drive.

Every topic has a [lesson](https://github.com/GWC-DCMB/ClubCurriculum/tree/master/Lessons) and a [practice](https://github.com/GWC-DCMB/ClubCurriculum/tree/master/Practices). The PDF version of the answer keys are in the directories so you can find the answer if you get stuck, but here are links: 
- [Lesson keys](https://github.com/GWC-DCMB/ClubCurriculum/tree/master/Lessons/_Keys/pdf)
- [Practice keys](https://github.com/GWC-DCMB/ClubCurriculum/tree/master/Practices/_Keys/pdf)

We encourage lots of googling and here is a [guide](https://github.com/GWC-DCMB/GWC-DCMB/blob/master/troubleshooting-checklist.md) for what to do when stuck! Join our [Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/dcmbgirlswhocode/shared_invite/zt-cl70c3pu-l61UdX4p~NwFtu0fMRim2g) and ask questions in the #officehours channel.
We also have [challenge questions](https://github.com/GWC-DCMB/challengeQuestions/tree/master/questions) for extensions of certain topics. You can navigate to these via Google Colab as well following the instructions in the first lesson (above).
