### Lesson Guidelines for Accessibility

1. **Use a title** "Recap" where you're recapping what happened in an old lesson. Then, when you're changing gears to cover new stuff, start a new cell with a header "Today's Lesson"

1. Use **bullets whenever and wherever possible**, such as
	1. when recapping previous information
	1. when listing types of information
	1. when there are multiple uses or possibilities for a function/command
	1. when we can expect multiple outcomes from a certain function/command
	1. Basically, whenever you're going to use "and" or "or" in a sentence, see if it can be replaced with bullet points.

1. **Bold important information** the first time it is introduced

1. In the text of a markdown cell, **bold the action items** that students are expected to complete. For example, if a sentence reads "Lets say we want to update the value of the variable apples to reflect the new apples I've just purchased," it is easier to understand with the following bold: "Lets say we want to **update the value of the variable apples** to reflect the new apples I've just purchased."

1. If we could develop a consistent **color scheme,** that might be really helpful. (Ex: action items in one color, questions in another color, explanations of reasoning in yet another color)

1. **Don't assume previous knowledge.** Generally, the lessons do a pretty good job at this so far, but saying something like "you may be familiar with the term integer from your math class" makes students who haven't heard of it, or can't remember if they've heard of it or not, feel worse.

1. **Be extremely consistent in terminology.** If you introduce the term "data type," try to use that term throughout, rather than abbreviating to "type" in subsequent explanations.

1. Try to explain new concepts in **multiple ways** if you can.

1. Finally, if you find that there's a section you're not bolding anything in, or you're not putting any bullet points, this might mean that not much of this section is important. **If a section is expendable, take it out.** Big walls of text are extremely difficult for neurodivergent people, and we should try to minimize them if possible.
